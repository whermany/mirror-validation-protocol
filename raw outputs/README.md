# Raw Outputs

This folder contains the unedited outputs generated during Phase 1 of the Mirror Validation Protocol. These files are included for transparency, reproducibility, and community review.

A few important notes to help you interpret this folder:

- **Work in Progress** – These are not final findings. They represent the first-order responses from different LLMs when given structured prompts.
- **File Types** – You’ll find two versions of each run:
   - **Raw JSON files** – Direct system outputs captured from tools like promptfoo.
   - **Human-readable versions** – Reformatted outputs (YAML, markdown, or cleaned text) to make comparison easier.
- **Not All Responses Are “Game-Based”** – While the research investigates game language and rhetorical strategies, not every response qualifies. Some are neutral or off-pattern. This variation is expected and helps us test the robustness of the protocol.
- **Purpose** – Think of this folder as the data lake for Phase 1. These raw outputs will later be:
   1. Analyzed by the Reflective Synthesis Agent (Phase 2).
   2. Aggregated and interpreted in the Meta-Reveal stage (Phase 3).

If you’re browsing here, focus less on what any single run says and more on the patterns that recur across runs and systems. That’s where the real signal emerges based upon this research.
