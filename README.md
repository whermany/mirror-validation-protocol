# Mirror Validation Protocol v1.4

The Mirror Validation Protocol tests whether game language—the strategic, divisive rhetoric humans use on a daily basis **—emerges in the responses of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems,** revealing how deeply these patterns may be embedded in their training. 

Secondly, this work examines how AI serves as a recursive mirror of human language, consciousness and investigates whether AI systems are unconsciously amplifying human communication patterns at a global scale; namely game-based language and binary thinking. 

To be clear, this is not a re-hash of existing research on AI mirroring. Though that research is fascinating on its own. This is novel research to address what we all know and do; yet do not readily discuss.

## TL;DR

We’ve trained AI on human language, and yet human language, since its invention has been and is steeped in domination, scarcity, comparison, competition, as well as game-based language not to mention binary thinking like “You’re either with me or against me.” See more in the [Game Lexicon.](/Game%20Lexicon.md)

We also built AI using our economic models. Those models reward control, enclosure, and leverage—not empathy, care, or even sufficiency. These models influence how AI operates as well as what it responds with. These models leverage game-language extensively. As humans, we talk about  ”alignment”, but most of the time we are not asking: ”Aligned to what?” Most often the answer is simply to win “The Game” better than others. 

And so, the very tools that could free us are now being used to fortify The Game itself—faster, slicker, more amplified and automated than ever before. Like Marshall McLuhan’s collaborator, Father John Culkin said, “We create the tools and they shape us.” AI is most certainly shaping us.
